  This header contains dynamic array template.
  Interface:
  -push_back(element) -creates element on the end of array. If there
  is no space it calls allocate_to(2x capacity) for space for additional elements   
  -pop_back()         -deletes last element. If number of elements is less than 1/4 of 
  capacity it calls allocate_to(capacity/2) to not wasting space 
  -insert(index, element) -inserts in index new element
  -operator[index]- returning pointer for element in index
  Private:
  -n              - number of elements
  -capacity       -current memory capacity in array
  -tab            -actual pointer to array
  -allocate_to(number)   - allocates new array with capacity=number. Can delete elements!

  WARNING: this implementation contains printing out some messages (mainly for debugging)
  Additional information: this implementation is inspired by the book: "Introduction to Algorithms" Cormen, Leiserson, Stein and Rivest
